## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** shown above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/bloodnet) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The input handler.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` followed by responding with `yes` when user confirmation is sought before the command is executed.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the above diagram),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`InputBox`, `OutputBox`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="650"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `handle("delete 1")` API call followed by a `handle("yes")` API call as an example in a freshly started program.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. Receive input
* The `Logic` is called upon to handle an input
2. Check for active session
* `Logic` checks for an active current session
* If there is no active current session:
    * The input is passed to a `BloodNetParser` object which in turns creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
    * This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`), which its `createSession` is invoked by `LogicManager`  to create a new `CommandSession` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `ConfirmationCommandSession`), which will become `LogicManager`'s `currentCommandSession`.
      * During the invoking of `createSession`, the `Command` object (depending on its implementation of `createSession`) may interact with the `Model` component to query target objects and/or perform validation checks.
3. Advance current session
* The current session is called upon to handle the input. 
* The result of the input handling is encapsulated as an `InputResponse` object.
* If the current command session has finished (as checked by its `isDone` method), the current session will be marked as `null`.
* The `InputResponse` object is then returned back from `Logic`.

#### Parsing
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `BloodNetParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `BloodNetParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### Command Sessions
`CommandSession` is an abstraction that has been developed to manage user interactivity during a command lifecycle in a maintainable and extensible way. It encapsulates the state and logic needed to handle multi-step (which includes single-step) interactions, while keeping the `Command` execution logic separate from input handling. Since `CommandSession` does not implement the `Command`'s execution logic itself, this logic is typically passed in during construction either by providing the `Command` object itself or by wrapping it in a help object (e.g., `DeferredExecution`).

By using sessions, the system can:
* Pause a command mid-lifecycle to wait for user input
* Maintain contextual information across multiple user inputs

To make the handling of user inputs (regardless of whether it is a command input or session input) uniform, **all commands create a `CommandSession` via `Command#createSession(Model model)**, regardless of whether they are interactive or single-step:
* **Interactive commands** (e.g., `delete`) creates a specialised session like `ConfirmationCommandSession` that manage multi-step interactions
* **Single-step commands** (e.g., `list`) creates a `SingleStepCommandSession` which immediately carry out the command's execution. This is the default behaviour of a `Command` if `Command#createSession(Model)` is not overridden.

THis design allows the `LogicManager` to **treat all user inputs uniformly**, using the presence or absence of a `currentCommandSession` to determine whether an input should be treated as a new command input.

The method `CommandSession#isDone()` is then used by `LogicManager` to determine whether a session has completed. Once it returns `true`, the session is cleaned up, clearing `currentCommandSession` and allowing the next command input to be processed.

The following activity diagram summarises the session lifecycle management when the user inputs something:
<puml src="diagrams/CommandSessionActivityDiagram.puml" width="600"/>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the BloodNet data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/BloodNet-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/bloodnet/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both bloodnet data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `BloodNetStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `bloodnet.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### User Confirmation
The user confirmation mechanism is facilitated by `ConfirmationCommandSession` class which is an implementation of `CommandSession` (See [Command Sessions](#command-sessions) for more details.)

The `ConfirmationCommandSession` class manages interactive commands that require explicit user confirmation before execution (i.e., destructive operations).
* When a command input is identified as requiring confirmation, the `LogicManager` invokes the parsed `Command`'s `createSession()` method, producing a `ConfirmationCommandSession` that stores the execution of the Command in a `deferredExecution` object.

To facilitate the handling of inputs within the context of its session, `ConfirmationCommandSession` maintains three internal states:

State                   | Description                                      | Transition Condition|
------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
`INITIAL`               | Default state immediately after creation. Ignores the original command input (since its information is already encapsulated within the deferred execution passed into it) and returns a confirmation prompt. | Automatically transitions to `PENDING_CONFIRMATION`.
`PENDING_CONFIRMATION`  | Waits for user input(`yes` or `no` (caps-insensitive)) <br><ul><li> `yes` -> carry out deferred execution of command.</li><li>`no` -> cancels command</li><li>Other input -> re-prompts user. | Transitions to `DONE` after confirmation or cancellation|
`DONE`                  | Terminal state indicating the session has completed. Any further `handle()` calls throw `TerminalSessionStateException` | -|

The following activity diagrams contrast the flow of a command requiring user confirmation and a single-step command:
<puml src="diagrams/ConfirmationCommandSessionActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ConfirmationCommandSessionActivityDiagram"/>

<puml src="diagrams/SingleStepCommandSessionActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SingleStepCommandSessionActivityDiagram"/>

For clarity, the above diagrams omit general session handling, command parsing and input delegation. See [**Command Sessions**](#command-sessions) for a complete overview.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a database of blood donors with detailed profile information
* requires quick access to donor personal information
* prefer desktop apps over other types of apps
* is able to type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* wants to filter profiles such as by blood type

**Value proposition**: manage blood donor profiles more efficiently as opposed to a typical mouse driven app

### **Use case: UC10 - Delete a blood donation record**

**Actor**: Admin staff

**MSS**

1. Admin staff requests to find a donor by their name.
2. BloodNet searches and displays donors with matching names.
3. Admin staff requests to list all blood donations by a specified donor.
4. BloodNet returns a list of blood donations, sorted by donation date in descending order.
5. Admin staff requests to delete a specified blood donation record.
6. BloodNet deletes the donation record.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. No donors match the search name.
    * Use case ends.

* 3a. Donor ID is invalid.
    * 3a1. BloodNet shows an error message.
    * Use case returns to step 3.

* 5a. Donation ID is invalid.
    * 5a1. BloodNet shows an error message.
      Use case returns to step 5.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons and the program should still be responsive with response time less than 1 second for each operation.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands rather than using the mouse.
4. Should start within 5 seconds on a typical user machine (4 core CPU, 8GB RAM, SSD).
5. User guide should be written with easy-to-understand English that is comprehensible to users without technical background.
6. The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-saavy.
7. Should not be required to have beautiful visual design or animations since it is for administrative use.
8. Should have user confirmation for _destructive operations_.
9. Should provide error message, in response to an invalid operation, that details what went wrong and how to fix it for a non-technical user.
10. Should be designed for a single user within a single computer.
11. Should back up contacts data within a human-editable file such that it persists across instances of the program.
12. Should work without requiring an installer.
13. Should be built into a JAR file of no larger than 100MB.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

    2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

## **Appendix: Effort**

In the course of the past few weeks, beyond just repurposing AB3 to a blood donor address book, we have made signficant upgrades to it, which involved substantial amount of hard work, ingenuity and late nights (just look at some of the commit timings):

### Having multiple entities, donors and donation records
...

### User confirmation
Wanting to safeguards against accidental destructive operations, we sought to implement user confirmation before such operations.

To accomplish, much complexity needed to be introduced. AB3 originally executes every user input as a new command immediately. But introducing user interactivity within a command (which user confirmation support requires) fundamentally change this flow requiring us to create a new abstraction, `commandSession`, to manage multi-step interactions and persist information throughout the command lifecycle until completion.

The implementation was challenging due to input delegation, differentiating between a new command input and an input within a command sesison, handling command exceptions resulting in mid-session exits, and maintaining consistent system state, all while providing a uniform framework compatible with single-step commands. Documentation also required careful revision as existing terms like "command", “execution” needed to be clarified and properly redesigned.

Overall, the feature involved considerable architectural changes, edge case handling, and documentation effort to balance usability and system safety.
